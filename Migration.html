        <h2>Movements of Populations:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Source - place that migrants come from</li>
            <li>Destination - where migrants go</li>
            <li>Interational Migration - when an individual or group of people cross an international border for more than 1 year</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Immigrant - someone who moves into a country</li>
                <li>Emigrant - someone who leaves their country</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Internal Migration - when people move from one place to another inside a country</li>
            <li>Net Migration - difference between in-movements(immigrants) and out-movements(emigrants)</li>
            <li>Migration stream - the common route that migrants take to get from a source to a destination</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Counter stream - reverse of the migation stream (people return home). Reduced volume of poeple</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Distance-Decay - as the distance increases (between source and destination), the number of migrants reduces</li>
            <div>&nbsp;</div> 
            <li><b>Permanent Migration:</b> Complete transfer of residence, often with the entire family</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Factors:</li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Employment opportunites (economic factor)</li>
                    <li>Family reunification (social factor)</li>
                    <li>Escape due to fear of death, for example in war areas (political factor)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Semi-permanent Migration:</b> Long-term stay in new location, but with the possibility or intention of returning back home (source)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Factors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Temporary work contract (economic)</li>
                    <li>Education (social)</li>
                    <li>Extended travel (social)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Temporary Migration:</b> Short-term movement, with intention of returning home after a limited period</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Factors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seasonal labor migration (economic)</li>
                    <li>Short-term educational courses (social)</li>
                    <li>Tourism/travel (social)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Typically individual rather than family migration</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Involuntary vs Voluntary Migration:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Voluntary - choose to move for better standard of living (better jobs and higher wages). Most of the time for economic reasons.</li>
                <li>Involuntary - forced to move to avoid extreme hardship, persecution, or death. These people are usually refugees</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Causes of Migration:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 types of migration:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Primitive - moving for physical farming factors</li>
                <li>Forced - slave trade, Chernobyl, natural disaster</li>
                <li>Impelled - under preceived threat</li>
                <li>Free - not forced</li>
                <li>Mass - high magnitude</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Push Factors:</b> reasons that encourage people to move away from source</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Civil wars</li>
                <li>Government corruption</li>
                <li>Government corruption</li>
                <li>Natural Disasters / climate condition</li>
                <li>Poor Employment and low income</li>
                <li>Bad education</li>
                <li>Bad healthcare</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Pull Factors:</b> positive aspects about the destination</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Job prospects and high income promise</li>
                <li>Higher living standard</li>
                <li>More entertainments</li>
                <li>Better education and healthcare</li>
                <li>Stabler government</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Chain Mirgation - after a few migrants leave, a chain reaction is set off, and many more follow</li>
            <li>Relay Mirgation - at different stages in the family life cycle, different people migrate to improve their financial situation</li>
            <li>Step Migration - rural migrants progressively step/move to bigger settlements (from rural town, to small town, to small city, to larger city etc...</li>
        </ul>
